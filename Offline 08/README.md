# Question 01

Write a program that lets the user type some text, consisting of words separated by blanks, ending with a carriage return, and displays the text in the same word order as entered, but with the letters in each word reversed.

# Question 02

Write a program that lets the user type in an algebraic expression, ending with a carriage return, that contains round (parentheses), square, and curly brackets. As the expression is being typed in, the program evaluates each character. If at any point the expression is incorrectly bracketed (too many right brackets or a mismatch between left and right brackets), the program tells the user to start over. After the carriage return is typed, if the expression is correct, the program displays "expression is correct." If not, the program displays "too many left brackets". In both cases, the program asks the user if he or she wants to continue. If the user types 'Y', the program runs again. Your program does not need to store the input string, only check it for correctness.
