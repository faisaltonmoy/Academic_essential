# Question 01

Write a program that lets the user enter time in seconds, up to 65535 and outputs the time as hours, minutes, and seconds.

# Question 02

Write a program to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers M and N, according to the following algorithm:

• Divide M by N, getting quotient Q and remainder R.
• If R = 0 then stop. N is the GCD of M and N.
• If R <> 0 replace M by N, N by R, and repeat step 1
